              I can honestly say that it was hell of a ride tumbling head first into a rabbit hole called Frontend Development.
              Since then I stared my first commercial work, gained ton of knowledge and learned a lot but it's just a beginning`}

              I guess I fell in love with baking because simillar as in frontend devlopment you can create something from almost nothing and can see the growth and development of the process. Other than that I really love metalcore and dogs.`}
